This project aims to explore the factors influencing the adoption of digital health tools among healthcare professionals(Doctors, Nurses, Community Health Extension workers, Pharmacist etc) and identify potential areas for improvement, leveraging data gotten from a Whatsapp community of health professionals. 

I began my professional journey on the first day of the lockdown in Nigeria. Seeing how the process of providing care and collection of health records were very inadequate. My center, General Hospital Odun, Lagos Island, transitioned from paper base to Electronic Medical records(EMRs), which I was very excited and supportive of. I even volunteered as an EMR trainer, training a good number of doctors on how to use the tool, and served as support for my colleagues. Since then, I have been a big advocate of the use of technology to improve health delivery. Post-Covid, there has been a notable increase in the use of EMRs and other digital tools to improve access to health services. 

Recently, I joined a WhatsApp community of young health professionals who are learning about and leveraging technology in medicine after reading several comments on slow adoption, poor building, and implementation of these tools and our perceived notion that these advancements were mainly happening in Lagos and Abuja. I decided to create a questionnaire and ask about the usage, adoption, and experiences of digital health tools, using the community as a sample. This way we can know if using digital tools actually improve our processes and have any impact on patients outcome. This could further inform us on how to go about Digital Health Adoption and improvements. 

Disclaimer: These results may not accurately reflect digital tool adoption in Nigeria, as this project is a practice exercise on using data analysis skills to examine and gain insights on the use of technology and current workflows in healthcare delivery.

### Insight 1

Before this, the other Health professionals and I argued that only Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja would have centers using digital health tools in their health facilities due to poor infrastructure in most of the other states in Nigeria. However, as predicted, Lagos has the highest number of health professionals and facilities using Digital health tools. Dataphyte reported that Lagos had the highest number of health facilities in 2022, with a total of 2,333. The survey found that 66.7% of healthcare professionals worked in Lagos-based facilities.

### Insight 2

Lagos has the highest number of health professionals who use digital health tools daily. This accounts for 15 health professionals out of 33, with Delta coming in 2nd highest with 3 health professionals using digital tools. However, Lagos also had the highest number of health professionals not using digital tools. Accounting for 7 out of 33.
