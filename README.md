## [Project: Exploring Digital Health Adoption and Challenges in Healthcare Professionals](https://github.com/Islamiaah/Exploring-Digital-Health-Adoption-and-Challenges-in-Healthcare-Professionals)

This project aims to explore the factors influencing the adoption of digital health tools among healthcare professionals(Doctors, Nurses, Community Health Extension workers, Pharmacist etc) and identify potential areas for improvement, leveraging data gotten from a Whatsapp community of health professionals. 

I began my professional journey on the first day of the lockdown in Nigeria. Seeing how the process of providing care and collection of health records were very inadequate. My center, General Hospital Odun, Lagos Island, transitioned from paper base to Electronic Medical records(EMRs), which I was very excited and supportive of. I even volunteered as an EMR trainer, training a good number of doctors on how to use the tool, and served as support for my colleagues. Since then, I have been a big advocate of the use of technology to improve health delivery. Post-Covid, there has been a notable increase in the use of EMRs and other digital tools to improve access to health services. 

Recently, I joined a WhatsApp community of young health professionals who are learning about and leveraging technology in medicine after reading several comments on slow adoption, poor building, and implementation of these tools and our perceived notion that these advancements were mainly happening in Lagos and Abuja. I decided to create a questionnaire and ask about the usage, adoption, and experiences of digital health tools, using the community as a sample. This way we can know if using digital tools actually improve our processes and have any impact on patients outcome. This could further inform us on how to go about Digital Health Adoption and improvements. 

Disclaimer: These results may not accurately reflect digital tool adoption in Nigeria, as this project is a practice exercise on using data analysis skills to examine and gain insights on the use of technology and current workflows in healthcare delivery.

### Insight 1

Before this, the other Health professionals and I argued that only Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja would have centers using digital health tools in their health facilities due to poor infrastructure in most of the other states in Nigeria. However, as predicted, Lagos has the highest number of health professionals and facilities using Digital health tools. Dataphyte reported that Lagos had the highest number of health facilities in 2022, with a total of 2,333. The survey found that 66.7% of healthcare professionals worked in Lagos-based facilities.

### Insight 2

Lagos has the highest number of health professionals who use digital health tools daily. This accounts for 15 health professionals out of 33, with Delta coming in 2nd highest with 3 health professionals using digital tools. However, Lagos also had the highest number of health professionals not using digital tools. Accounting for 7 out of 33. 

### Insight 3

The majority of health professionals rated themselves as having the highest level of Digital Health Tool Proficiency. Most health professionals reported being satisfied and very satisfied (rating 4 or 5) with using digital health tools to deliver healthcare services. Healthcare professionals who are highly satisfied with their use of digital tools reported significant improvements in workflow and productivity. There is a strong correlation between the quality of training and the level of satisfaction. Respondents who received high-quality training reported greater satisfaction when using digital tools.

### Insight 5

Doctors showed the highest level of EMR proficiency compared to other health professionals. Lagos also showed the highest level of EMR proficiency compared to other states.

### Insights 6

33.3% of respondents identified "Technical Issues" as the main challenge when using Digital Health Tools.
42% Health professionals reported Inadequate Technological Infrastructure like slow internet connections and use of outdated hardware as the major barrier to the adoption of digital health tools.

### Insight 7 

![](/Images/Training%20quality%20.png)

Most health professionals scored the quaility of training they got on using Digital healt tools as 4/5. Which means the training was good. 

About 97% of Health Professionals are motivated to improve their digital health skills
Health professionals gave actionable recommedations in the designing and implementation of digital tools
The Recommendations are to:
- Make digital tools more user friendly.
- Address privacy concerns through improved security measures.
- Update software and stable internet connection.
- Ensure interoperability with Clinical Desicion support.


While this project is not concluded and i need more data from all over the country to fully understand the state of Digital health adoption in the country. 
From this current analysis, the main challenges and barrier to adoption are technical issues like lack of software, hardware, slow internet connections or even use of outdated hardware.
